# ImpossibleFoxLite
**Lite version of Impossible fox.**     
To install delete ALL files and folders from your chrome folder and put userChrome.css into it. If you have fx-autoconfig maybe need clean startup cache too.     
Unlike the full version, search hints work here, so you can enable them in the `about:config` page: set `browser.urlbar.maxRichResults` to 10.
